# graph-c

## This is a code of a graph implemented in C.

# How to use this graph ?

First of all yo have to allocate memory for the graph. which you can do with following.

```c
graphT *myg1=NULL , *myg2 = NULL;
     if(argc <2 ){
         fprintf(stderr,"Usage: %s graph_name" , argv[0]);
         exit(-1);
     }
    myg1 = (graphT *)malloc(sizeof(graphT));
```
They you can use following method to implement the graph as you wish.

### 1.initialize the graph
This will initialize the graph. There are two parameters which you should pass.
One is the graph *myg1* second is the directionality of the graph.
*TRUE* if directed *FALSE* if undirected.
```c
initialize_graph(myg1, FALSE);
```
